🎥 Live Object Detection & Tracing

📌 Overview

This project is a real-time object detection system built using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit WebRTC. It detects and tracks objects from a live camera feed and automatically saves frames as images whenever objects are detected.

The system is optimized for smooth performance and includes object counting, alerts, and intelligent frame saving.

📸 How It Works

The system accesses your webcam using WebRTC. Each video frame is processed using YOLOv8. Detected objects are: Labeled and tracked Counted in real-time If objects are detected: The frame is automatically saved every few seconds Alerts are triggered for specific objects (e.g., "person") 🧠 Key Functionalities

✔ Object Counting

Displays the number of detected objects per class (e.g., person, phone).

✔ Alert System

Shows alert text when a specific object is detected:

ALERT_OBJECT = "person"

✔ Automatic Frame Saving

Saves frames only when objects are detected Uses time interval to avoid duplicate images Saved images location:

saved_frames/

⚡ Performance Optimization

Frame resizing (640x480) to reduce processing load Lightweight YOLO model ("yolov8n.pt") Controlled frame saving using time intervals ⚠️ Limitations

On Streamlit Cloud, saved images are temporary and may be deleted after app restart Requires a working webcam Detection accuracy depends on lighting and camera quality 🎯 Future Enhancements
